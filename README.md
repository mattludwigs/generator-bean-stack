# Bean Stack for Yoeman

This is a generator that sets up a simple bean stack. What is a bean stack you ask. Well it is Bootstrap, Express, Angular, and Node. At the basic level this gives you a simple bootstrap and angular set up with an Express server.

## How to Develop

First you will need to get Yoemon installed on your computer. Assuming you have node, and thus npm, enter this:

```
$ npm install -g yoeman
```
